###Shopping Calculator in Angular JS

This is a shopping calculator built in Angular JS that I built 15 minutes after my first introduction to Angular JS. CSS is powered by Bootstrap and the code is native Javascript (except the AngularJS file ofcourse).

####What's to like

Angular makes MVC for the web very easy. HTML becomes a templating engine and Javascript the core language. It's fun and powerful and writing powerful apps is possible with the smallest amount of code. I just scratched the surface of Angular and I'm very impressed.

####What's in this repository

Pretty basic Angular stuff and I'm keeping it here for rememberance. 3 JS files, a server.bat file for creating the server in Python, 1 small CSS file and the main index.html.

####Conclusion

AngularJS is an awesome javascript framework built by the gurus at Google. I'll be writing more Angular code in the future. This is just the beginning.
